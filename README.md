# Week 1 Progress

## Architecture

#### For this project we will use Single Page App Architecture, since it is the simplest to implement for our topic

## Tech Stack

#### As mentioned in the project requirements, we are required to use Next.js for the Frontend and Node.js for the Backend, as well as RestfulAPI for the API, so we will also use that for our project

## Project Topic

#### For our project, we decided to pick Homework Question & Answer Assistant
