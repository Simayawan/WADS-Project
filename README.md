# 3. Project Overview

## 3.1 Problem Statement
#### Not all students have the capacity to self study, and some do not have the courage to ask their peers or teacher fearing ridicule or other problems, which is why students tend to get help from the internet, and more recently AI. Which is why we aim to solve that problem by making a Homework QnA assistant, which will help the students understand the problems they are confused with better.

## 3.2 Solution Statement

#### The web App will be able to accept questions via text or images, but also have a dedicated calculator for more scenarios that involved math, the Web app will then give the step by step solution to that problem. This solution is appropriate for the problem because students will have problems that is inside different formats, they might have a physical question sheet that is difficult to retype, a digital question sheet that is faster if it was done via text, or that they have a math pronblem which is better if they typed themselves due to limitations of image recognition or that the image recognition had an error and the student have to fix it but are not able to if the web app did not have the capabiity to manually write the math equation. AI would be used for 2 things, the first one is OCR for it to accept and recognize images, and the second is NLP for answering the questions and giving detailed explainations.

# 4. Technology Stack (Mandatory)

##### Frontend - Next.js
#### Backend - Node.js
#### API - REST API
#### Database - PosteGreSQL
#### Containerization - Docker
#### Deployment - Render (Docker-based cloud deployment)
#### Version Control - Github

# 5. System Architecture

## 5.1 Architecture Diagram



## 5.2 Architecture Explaination

#### For this application will be made using Single Page Application Architecture using Next.js for the frontend, then Restful API for the backend using Node.js. The backend will have an architecture that seperates the controller, business logic, and the database access layers.
